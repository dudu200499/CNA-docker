Student Exam Qualification Checker

This Python console application determines whether a student qualifies to write an exam based on their weighted average of four assessments:

- **Test 1** (30%)
- **Test 2** (50%)
- **Assignment 1** (10%)
- **Project** (10%)

A student qualifies for the exam if their **weighted average is 50 or above**.
